# About the Dataset

# Inspiration
I wanted to contribute to the Data Science community by working on this real-life dataset. The community has always provided me with valuable feedback and encouragement, so I decided to work on this e-commerce shop's sales data as a way of giving back.

# About the Data
The dataset includes all sales recorded from June to September 2022. To protect privacy and confidentiality, customers' personal information was not included, and irrelevant features were removed to simplify the dataset.

# Contents
This dataset contains the following columns:

- order_id: unique identifier for each order placed
- order_date: date and time of the order
- SKU: a number used by retailers to identify their products
- color: the color of the product
- size: size of the product (treat missing values as "One Size")
- unit_price: the unit price of the product
- quantity: quantity ordered for that particular product
- revenue: total revenue generated from the sale (unit_price * quantity)
